Release notes

********************************************************************************
1.0a rev4

	- Anything 'protected' is now 'private'. If I ever decide to make it more 
	  extendable, I'll add protected getters and setters. I'll keep it safe for
	  now.
	  
	- TextFields without matrices do not throw errors anymore (identity matrix
	  used).
	  
	- Fixed typos in the documentation.

********************************************************************************
1.0a rev3

	- Another gain in performance was achieved by only comparing the data inside
	  the intersection of the objects.

	- The findCollisions() method has been renamed to simply detect().
	
	- There is now a 'debug' mode which draws outlines inside the 'outlines'
	  property (Sprite). This sprite can be put on stage to help visualize the
	  detection process.

********************************************************************************
1.0a rev2

	- The alphaThreshold now defaults to 1/255 (≈ 0.004). This means anything
	  but completely transparent will trigger a collision.
	  
	- The alphaThreshold getter now reports the proper value.
	
	- Performance has been improved (at least 2x) when both calculateAngles and 
	  calculateOverlap are false (which is the default behaviour).

********************************************************************************
1.0a rev1

	- AirBag now extends the EventDispatcher class. It is now therefore possible 
	  to listen to the following events: AirBagEvent.COLLISION (when at least 
	  one collision is detected) and AirBagEvent.DETECTION (whenever detection
	  is performed, typically on ENTER_FRAME).
	 
	- New AirBagEvent class.
	
	- Updated doc and examples.
